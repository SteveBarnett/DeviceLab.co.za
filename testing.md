##  why test?

* makes business sense! for us and client.
	* increase likelihood of good ROI, good lead generation
	* make sure design communicates messages clearly and that users are guided to calls to action
	* can save money: catch mistakes / wrong directions early
	* You want to deliver value to stakeholders. Widely testing is one way to do this.
	* Reduces risk to company. Catch more bugs, catch them earlier.

### How much, and when?

* any testing better than no testing
* the more you can test the better.
* needs to be integrated throughout process

## Why test on mobile?

### Philosophy

Exciting and challenging.

#### One Web

* People should be able to access all of your web site quickly and easily, regardless of the device they’re using, the type of connection they are on, or any disabilities they have. The right thing to do and good business sense.
	* functional experience, not identical.
* power of the web is its ubiquity

#### Future Friendly

* internet-connected device zombie apocalypse is coming, we must prepare.
* Chase the future rather than just catching up with the present, and getting left behind.

#### Mobile First

* Mobile forces focus: information hierarchy and user goals. Smaller screen, varying contexts, results in just key tasks and content.
* Mobile has more capabilities. GPS, orientation, touch input, accelerometer, etc.
* How do the capabilities of different types of devices open up possibilities for interacting with content that didn’t exist before?


### Business

#### Go where your customers are / Your brand and experience needs to be where people are

* part of cross-channel strategy
* be where consumers are.  use the medium or mediums that are most likely to succeed.
	* many types of customers engage heavily, and are almost constantly connected, with their device, so it's an effective way of reaching them.

#### New opportunities

* what opportunities are created when a user is not tethered to a desk? What if they’re on a couch, at work or standing around somewhere?
* opportunity to reboot, especially if current user satisfaction low.

#### Mobile access to web

* low penetration of both computers and fixed line Internet access in South Africa.
* mobile web uptake driven by social networks as entry point

#### How are people using their devices?

* mobile used for research, then buy (mobile is an emerging point of purchase) or on desktop, or in shop.
* increasingly used as second screen, multitasking device.

#### "No one looks at our site using mobile"

* Analytics may under-report mobile customers. Trackers often use js, so no js or bad js may not be reported.
* mobile bounce rate higher than desktop.
* They will! Mobile access increasing.
