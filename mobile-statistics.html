  <p>Mobile is showing continued and rapid growth across a wide range of metrics: sales, internet usage (especially search), advertising, e-commerce, and social networking. In <strong>January 2014</strong>, the split of web use worldwide was about <strong>one quarter mobile, three quarters desktop</strong>. Many users don&#8217;t have access to a fixed-line or a desktop computer, so their mobile device is their only access to the internet.</p>

  <p>Mobile use in South Africa is particulary high: <a href="http://naga.co.za/2014/02/26/mobile-stats-for-january-2014/">about two-thirds of all web use comes from mobile devices</a>. The split of types of devices is very different from the rest of the world, too: BlackBerry devices are still very popular here, and Nokia's range of featurephones running their Series 40 and Symbian operating systems are still used by many people.</p>

  <p>Many more detailed statistics are available from <a href="#statisticssources">the sources listed below</a>.</p>

  </header>

  <p>Given that mobile web access is increasingly popular, we should be building sites that work well on mobile devices. The big question is: <a href="/testing-on-mobile/">how do we do rigorous testing on mobile?</a></p>

  <p>Doing so is <a href="/testing-on-mobile/#philosophy">good for developers</a> because it helps our sites reach as many people, on as many devices, as possible. The focus that mobile brings also helps us produce lighter, leaner, sites.</p>

  <p>Testing on mobile is also <a href="/testing-on-mobile/#business">good for our clients</a>. If their customers aren&#8217;t already using their site on mobile, they will be soon. Mobile offers a new channel, and new opportunities for businesses to connect with their existing customers and to pull in new ones.</p>
