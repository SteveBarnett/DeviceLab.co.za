Internet access across the world is increasing at a rapid pace. The change is especially noticable with mobile devices. Many people have no fixed-line access to the web, instead relying on their mobile device. Web sites and web apps are being used across a wider range of software and hardware than ever before.

In order to provide the best product and the most value to users and clients, it's necessary to test across a wide range of platforms: mobile is the most exciting and the most challenging of these.

[Why is testing for mobile important?](testing-on-mobile.md)

Mobile Operating System and Browser emulators offer a reasonable way of testing layout, but can suffer from errors or differences in performance and behaviour. The best way of testing is to get hands-on and use the site as the users will: on actual devices.

## Nomad Device Lab

**Nomad Device Lab** is a traveling, curated, collection of mobile devices that can work with you to do practical and efficient testing.

* **A travelling lab.** It comes to your office, your environment, to conveniently fit in with your existing workflow.
* **A curated collection.** The devices in the lab are selected to match market growth and penetration, with a slant towards local trends. The selection is based on research and statistics and is regularly, but not frequently, updated.

* **Mobile devices.** Portable, internet-enabled, devices: not traditional desktop computers. The lab contains feature phones, smartphones, tablets, and will contain whatever comes next.

* **A practical means of testing.** The number of devices is kept small enough that testing can be done across all the full range in a short period of time.

* **An efficient means of testing.** The lab is brought to you by an experienced front end web developer, who is on hand to assist your team and offer quick, specific, solutions.

## Services

Nomad Device Lab offers a range of service based around the lab.

### On-site testing

Our main offering is **on-site testing sessions**, run in half-day increments. This is particularly useful near the start of a project to identify problems that could be costly to fix later.

The lab comes to you and helps you find and identify bugs quickly. If it fits with your process, the bugs can also be fixed during the session. After the session, a brief report is provided detailing what speed, performance, layout, and usability issues were found, and what was done about them.

### Off-site testing

Off-site testing is a good alternative when testing time is scarce, but development time is available, or if you have an existing desktop site that you want to make more mobile-friendly.

Reports on your site are produced off-site, using the lab, are inform you about mobile-specific issues for your project. In the case of retro-fitting a desktop site, the report provides some examples of specific fixes that could be implemented, tagged with priority and complexity in line with your existing metrics.

### Consulting

Nomad Device Lab also offers consulting advice on building your own lab: which devices should you have?
This is useful for companies that have the budget for a lab, but not the time to spend on research and statistical analysis to inform the right selection of devices.

Nomad Device Lab can also advise on the practical, physical side (storage, usage), and help kickstart your development team's knowledge by discussing common pitfalls across specific platforms.
