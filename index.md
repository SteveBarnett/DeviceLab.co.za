Internet access across the world is increasing at a rapid pace. The change is especially noticable with mobile devices. Many people have no fixed-line access to the web, instead relying on their mobile device. Web sites and web apps are being used across a wider range of software and hardware than ever before.

In order to provide the best product and the most value to users and clients, it's necessary to test across a wide range of platforms: mobile is the most exciting and the most challenging of these.

Mobile Operating System and Browser emulators offer a reasonable way of testing layout, but can suffer from errors or differences in performance and behaviour. The best way of testing is to get hands-on and use the site as the users will: on actual devices.

## Nomad Device Lab

**Nomad Device Lab** is a traveling, curated, collection of mobile devices that can work with you to do practical and efficient testing.

* **A travelling lab.** It comes to your office, your environment, to conveniently fit in with your existing workflow.
* **A curated collection.** The devices in the lab are selected to match market growth and penetration, with a slant towards local trends. The selection is based on research and statistics and is regularly, but not frequently, updated.

* **Mobile devices.** Portable, internet-enabled, devices: not traditional desktop computers. The lab contains feature phones, smartphones, tablets, and will contain whatever comes next.

* **A practical means of testing.** The number of devices is kept small enough that testing can be done across all the full range in a short period of time.

* **An efficient means of testing.** The lab is brought to you by an experienced front end web developer, who is on hand to assist your team and offer quick, specific, solutions.
