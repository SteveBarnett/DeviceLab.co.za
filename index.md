# Nomad device lab

Mobile web access is exploding, and the sites we build should run well and look good on as many platforms as possible. A big part of this is testing: does it work as well for the person sitting at the desk, with a big monitor and a mouse, as it does for the person lying onthe couch, using their touch-screen smartphone

How do we do this testing? 

## Nomad Device Lab is a traveling, curated, collection of mobile devices with an on-site expert that works with you to do practical and efficient testing.

### What does this mean?

* **mobile**: shorthand for portable devices. feature phones, smartphones, tablets, and whatever comes next. Not traditional desktop computers.
* **travelling**: your office, your environment.
* **curated**: devices, selected to match (mostly local) market growth and penetration, based on research and statistics. regularly, but not frequently, updated.
	* High-level, close-enough, device categories.. focus is on long term functional support for as many devices as possible, not short term perfection for specific devices, along the lines of the 80/20 rule.
* **practical**: the number of devices is relatively small.
* **efficient**: me on hand to offer help and quick, specific solutions.


##  why test?

* makes business sense! for us and client.
	* increase likelihood of good ROI, good lead generation
	* make sure design communicates messages clearly and that users are guided to calls to action
	* can save money: catch mistakes / wrong directions early
	* You want to deliver value to stakeholders. Widely testing is one way to do this.
	* Reduces risk to company. Catch more bugs, catch them earlier.

### How much, and when?

* any testing better than no testing
* the more you can test the better.
* needs to be integrated throughout process
