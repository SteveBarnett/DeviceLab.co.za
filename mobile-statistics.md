# Mobile Statistics

Mobile is showing continued and rapid growth across a wide range of metrics: sales, internet usage (especially search), advertising, e-commerce, and social networking.

More detailed information is available from the sites in the [sources section](#statisticssources).

First we look at the [Global](#global) situation, then at [South Africa](#southafrica) more specifically. Finally we look at the [current state of affairs](#2012), and the percentage of users for whom [mobile is their main or only form of web access](#mobileonlyusers).

## What do we do about it?

Given that mobile web access is increasingly popular, what is the next step for developers? [Testing on mobile](testing-on-mobile.md).

Doing so is [good for developers](testing-on-mobile.md#philosophy) because it helps our sites reach as many people, on as many devices, as possible. The focus that mobile brings also helps us produce lighter, leaner, sites. [Why is testing on mobile good for developers?

Testing on mobile is also [good for our clients](testing-on-mobile.md#business). If their customers aren't already using their site on mobile, they will be soon. Mobile offers a new channel, and new opportuniites for businesses to connect with their existing customers and to pull in new ones.
