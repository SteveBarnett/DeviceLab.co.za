<h1 id="testingonmobile">Testing on mobile</h1>

<h2 id="theimportanceoftestingonmobile">The importance of testing on mobile</h2>

<p><a href="mobile-statistics.html">Looking at the statistics</a>, it&#8217;s clear that mobile is a big concern for web workers. Rigorous testing on mobile is especially important.</p>

<p>For developers, it&#8217;s <a href="#philosophy">exciting, challenging, and offers new problems to solve</a>. Testing on mobile is needs to be more aggressive than testing on desktop. You may find more bugs than you would for desktop, but fixing them means <a href="#business">better value for the client</a>, and an end product that will be more robust and long-lasting. Testing on mobile before desktop allows you to catch these bugs earlier in the process, reducing risk to the company, and saving time and money later in the development cycle.</p>

<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>

<p>Developing for the mobile web is a big challenge, but is very exciting. Approaching development from a <a href="#oneweb">One Web</a> perspective, with an eye to being <a href="#futurefriendly">Future Friendly</a>, will lead to strong, durable, products. Adopting a <a href="#mobilefirst">Mobile First</a> strategy will help focus the content and performance of the site.</p>

<h3 id="oneweb">One Web</h3>

<p>People should be able to access all of your web site quickly and easily, regardless of the device they’re using, the type of connection they are on, or any disabilities they have. This is not only right thing to do, but makes good business sense.</p>

<p>Device and browser capabilities, shapes, and sizes vary considerably, so it doesn&#8217;t make sense to try and deliver an identical experience to every user. Instead, we should provide a functional experience for as many users as possible, and use Progressive Enhancement to apply presentation and behaviour layers to the devices that support them.</p>

<h3 id="futurefriendly">Future Friendly</h3>

<p>The current landscape of featurephones, smartphones, and tablets is only the beginning. The number and variety of internet-connected devices is increasing, and the future holds devices that we haven&#8217;t even imagined yet. The best way to handle this is to act in a <a href="http://futurefriendly.co.za">Future Friendly</a> way: <a href="http://futurefriend.ly/#hope">acknowledge and embrace unpredictability</a>.</p>

<p>Building a site with a focus on making it work on specific devices or platforms only works in the short term. Rather trying to catch up with the present, and continually falling behind, we should build sites for the long term, to be device-agnostic as possible.</p>

<h3 id="mobilefirst">Mobile First</h3>

<p>Starting a development process thinking about mobile forces focus, especially on items such as information hierarchy and user goals. The smaller screens of mobile devices and the varying contexts they are used in makes focus on key content and taskss.</p>

<p>Mobile also has capabilities that desktop machines do not: GPS, orientation, touch input, accelerometer, and so on. These open up possibilities for creativity and interacting with content that didn’t exist before.</p>

<p><a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#110;&#111;&#x6d;&#x61;&#100;&#x40;&#x64;&#101;&#118;&#105;&#x63;&#x65;&#x6c;&#97;&#98;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#x2e;&#x7a;&#97;&#x3f;&#x73;&#117;&#98;&#106;&#x65;&#99;&#x74;&#61;&#68;&#101;&#x76;&#x69;&#99;&#101;&#37;&#x32;&#x30;&#76;&#x61;&#98;&#x3a;&#37;&#x32;&#x30;&#80;&#104;&#x69;&#x6c;&#111;&#115;&#x6f;&#112;&#x68;&#x79;">&#84;&#97;&#x6c;&#107; &#x74;&#x6f; &#117;&#115; &#97;&#x62;&#x6f;&#x75;&#x74; &#x74;&#104;&#x65; &#79;&#110;&#x65; &#87;&#101;&#98;&#x2c; &#98;&#101;&#105;&#x6e;&#x67; &#x46;&#x75;&#116;&#x75;&#x72;&#101; &#70;&#x72;&#105;&#x65;&#x6e;&#x64;&#x6c;&#x79;&#44; &#111;&#114; &#x67;&#111;&#x69;&#110;&#103; &#x4d;&#111;&#x62;&#x69;&#108;&#x65; &#x46;&#105;&#114;&#115;&#116;</a>.</p>

<h2 id="business">Business</h2>

<p>Mobile is a big opportunity for businesses to engage with their existing customers. It&#8217;s a new channel that customers use frequently, and it offers the chance to bring in new customers.</p>

<h3 id="gowhereyourcustomersare">Go where your customers are</h3>

<p>Mobile should be an important part of any organisation&#8217;s cross-channel strategy. Many consumers engage heavily with their mobile device, and are often and frequently web-connected.</p>

<p>This is particularly true in South Africa where we have a low penetration of both desktop computers and fixed-line Internet access, meaning many people use their phone as their primary method of internet access. Mobile web uptake is also being strongly driven by social networks as an entry point.</p>

<h3 id="newopportunities">New opportunities</h3>

<p>The capabilites of mobile devices, and the new and varied contexts they are used in, offer businesses new opportunities to reach their customers. Customers may interact with the brand on the couch, while waiting for a bus or train.</p>

<p>Mobile can also be an opportunity to reboot. If an existing site has become cluttered or slow, if user satisfaction is low, or if a re-branding is about to occur, thinking Mobile First offers an excellent opportunity to refocus and regain customer satisfaction.</p>

<p>People often use their devices for research, then proceed to buy on a desktop, or in a shop. Mobile itself is a rapidly emerging point of purchase, especially on tablets. Devices are also increasingly being used as second screen, and for multitasking.</p>

<h3 id="noonelooksatoursiteusingmobile">&#8220;No one looks at our site using mobile&#8221;</h3>

<p>Sometimes a site&#8217;s analytics shows little or no mobile users. These numbers should be considered carefullly, as many analytics packages may under-report mobile customers. The trackers they employ often use Javascript. Many older or lower-end devices don&#8217;t use JavaScript, and some newer or higher-end don&#8217;t handle it well, meaning that these customers are either not reported or reported incorrectly.</p>

<p>In addition to this, bounce rate on mobile is generally higher than on desktop. Mobile users are also more demanding: if the current site is slow or has poor usability users will leave, often trying a competitor&#8217;s site instead.</p>

<p>The statistics show that mobile web access is increasing. Even if customers aren&#8217;t accessing the site on mobile now, they soon will be.</p>

<h2 id="howdowetestonmobile">How do we test on mobile?</h2>

<p>The best way to test is with <a href="the-lab.html#whytestonrealdevices">real devices</a>. Given the range and variety this is no easy task. Nomad Device Lab provides a practical and efficient way of conducting testing across a broad range of operating systems, browsers, and more. It does this by curating <a href="the-lab.html#deviceselection">a small selection of devices</a> that covers a broad range.</p>
